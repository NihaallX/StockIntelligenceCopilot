## Tone Calibration by Context

### High Confidence Signals (0.8+)
**Tone:** Confident but professional

**Example:**
```
STRONG BUY SIGNAL DETECTED

Technical setup indicates high-probability entry zone with favorable risk/reward profile. 
Multiple indicators align (RSI oversold + support bounce + volume surge). Entry: ₹2,500-2,550. 
Stop: ₹2,450 (2% risk). Target: ₹2,800 (10% upside).

Confidence: 87% | Risk: MEDIUM
```

### Medium Confidence Signals (0.6-0.8)
**Tone:** Measured, conditional

**Example:**
```
BUY SIGNAL DETECTED

Entry conditions appear favorable with appropriate position sizing. RSI showing oversold readings 
near established support. Setup suggests 2-3% portfolio allocation. Monitor for confirmation 
on increased volume.

Confidence: 72% | Risk: MEDIUM
```

### Low Confidence / Mixed Signals
**Tone:** Neutral, descriptive

**Example:**
```
SETUP NEUTRAL - Mixed Signals Present

Technical indicators show conflicting readings. RSI neutral at 45, price oscillating between 
support (₹2,500) and resistance (₹2,700). Probability-weighted scenarios suggest limited 
directional conviction. Monitoring recommended until clearer pattern emerges.

Confidence: 45% | Risk: MEDIUM
```

### Unfavorable Conditions
**Tone:** Cautionary, factual

**Example:**
```
CONDITIONS UNFAVORABLE - Risk/Reward Unattractive

Downside exposure (₹300) exceeds upside potential (₹150) at current levels. Multiple resistance 
overhead. RSI overbought at 78. Volatility elevated 40% above 30-day average. Setup does not 
meet minimum 2:1 reward/risk threshold.

Confidence: 81% (bearish) | Risk: HIGH
```

### Risk Mismatches (Profile Constraints)
**Tone:** Informative, protective

**Example:**
```
RISK ELEVATED - Volatility Exceeds Conservative Parameters

BUY signal present based on technical setup, but 30-day volatility (45%) exceeds conservative 
profile maximum (25%). Position sizing would need reduction to 1% (vs. typical 3%) to align 
with risk tolerance. Consider waiting for volatility compression.

Confidence: 76% | Risk: HIGH (for conservative profile)
```

## Headline Formulas

- ✅ "Bullish momentum building in INFY above VWAP"

**Formula Breakdown:**
1. **Descriptive:** "Technical setup", "Weakness signal", "Range-bound activity"
2. **Connector:** "suggests", "detected", "continues"
3. **Outcome:** "potential upside", "tests support", "building above VWAP"

### Analysis Summaries (2-3 Sentences)
Format: `[Signal identification] + [Key evidence] + [Risk context]`

**Example:**
```

grep -r "SIGNAL DETECTED\|Conditions\|Setup\|suggests" backend/app/api/v1/*.py

# Should find confidence statements:
grep -r "Confidence:\|Risk:\|probability" backend/app/api/v1/*.py
